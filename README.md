The Image Conversion to Grayscale project provides a simple script to convert a set of images from a specified directory to grayscale. It utilizes the OpenCV library for image processing.

Install the dependencies:

``pip install opencv-python``

Place the images you want to convert to grayscale in a directory named images within the project folder.

Run the script:

``python convert_to_grayscale.py``

The converted grayscale images will be saved in a directory named grayimages within the project folder.
